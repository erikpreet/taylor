  		I know we are going through a rough patch right now, but all relationships have them. If we both want to be together, we both need to put in the work. If we are going to to the long distance thing, then we have to do things differently. But now is not the time to bottle up things, it's time to let it all out on the table and to be open. 
      <br>
      <br>

You know we have been in each other's lives for eight years now. It's crazy to think that. From freshmen year, you'd rage during class and Xbox! To now, you are in Japan teaching! You know, when you said I am always negative it hurt me. I thought it was the normal teasing I do to you. Like how I say vaporwave is trash and stuff, I don't believe that, but I figured it was coming off light-hearted. I guess I didn't realize it was bleeding into other things and I need to be more reinforcing in your likes and stuff. I think we both can do more positive reinforcement. So I want to apologize for that. But it's your birthday coming up! So happy 22nd birthday, I wanted to do something different this year. Your gifts are picked out after doing a weeks worth of research. I have calculated the best selection of presents. They will come one after another all, better than the last.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
